schema-tourism-ds-visualizer
============================

This repo started as a Wordpress Website (branch: master).
Then it got adapted to be a standalone application (branch: standalone -> used on production)

TODO:

- make branches cleverer again :D

ok
and i guess it will never see daylight? so we may rename the "standalone" version to "master" (which is the wordpress version) and delete that master if we are not going to use it, or rename it to "wordpress".   https://bitbucket.org/sti2/schema-tourism-ds-visualizer/src/

hard to say. depends a lot on the outcome of a meeting on Dez. the 17.. But still, the standalone version could be the master which can be modularized and used insied whatever WP installation.
